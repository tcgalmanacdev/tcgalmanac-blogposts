Have you ever scoured the internet in search of the latest and greatest Pokémon cards of 2024, only to come up empty-handed? Well, fret no more, because you've stumbled upon the right place (or at least, I hope you have).
Welcome to my inaugural blog post for TCG Almanac! My aim is to arm you with all the juicy details you need to impress your friends with your newfound Pokémon card knowledge. And hey, if the information falls short, don't hesitate to let me know. I'm all ears for constructive criticism... and maybe a good roasting or two.

Today, I'm thrilled to delve into some of the coolest cards to grace the Pokémon scene in 2024, hailing from the recent Scarlet and Violet sets. We'll be exploring cards from sets like Temporal Forces, Paradox Rift, and my personal favorite, Paldean Fates.

Unfortunately, I'll have to hold off on discussing Twilight Masquerade until its release.
Throughout this article, I'll be spotlighting what I believe are the cream of the crop in 2024's Pokémon card lineup. Remember, art is subjective. Some cards might break the bank, while others could be budget-friendly. But one thing's for sure – in this article, we're celebrating nothing but pure beauty.

# Background:

My journey into collecting Pokémon TCG is a relatively recent one, but oh boy, am I hooked. I owe it all to my brother, who gifted me a CGC 9 Charizard - Celebrations: Classic Collection for my birthday, a good 20 years after we first started collecting. Back in the day, we couldn't afford booster packs, so we relied on hand-me-down cards from other kids. We traded and traded, always chasing that elusive Charizard from the base set. And now, well, let's just say I've developed a bit of an addiction... Gotta Catch 'Em All, right?

# Criteria:

But enough about me, let's dive into what makes a Pokémon card truly stand out:

## Essence:

The artwork should embody the unique personality and essence of the Pokémon it portrays. Whether it's Pikachu's infectious energy or Charizard's fierce presence, the illustration should capture the very spirit of the Pokémon.

## Dynamic Composition:

A visually captivating and dynamic composition is key to grabbing attention.

## Background Storytelling:

Background elements should enrich the Pokémon's story, offering glimpses into its habitat, lore, or relationships with other Pokémon and trainers.

## Artistic Style:

Embracing various artistic styles, from 2D to 3D, abstract to line art, can breathe new life into a Pokémon's depiction.

With these criteria in mind, let's embark on a journey through the coolest Pokémon cards of 2024, where beauty knows no bounds.

## Coolest Cards of 2024:

1. [Deerling](#deerling)
2. [Litten](#litten)

<a name="deerling"></a>![Deerling SV5-165](https://tcgalmanac.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.pokemontcg.io%2Fsv5%2F165_hires.png&w=1080&q=75)

### <a href="https://tcgalmanac.com/PokeCard/sv5-165" target="_blank">Deerling (SV5-165)</a>

Illustrated by Susumu Maeya, is a delightful and vibrant card. The artwork beautifully depicts the changing seasons through analogous color schemes, portraying the innocence of childhood as Deerling joyfully frolics through the forest. When paired with <a href="https://tcgalmanac.com/PokeCard/sv5-166" target="_blank">Sawsbuck (SV5-166)</a>, it forms a cohesive diptych, creating a unified image that captures the essence of nature's beauty.

### <a href="https://tcgalmanac.com/PokeCard/sv5-167" target="_blank">Litten (SV5-167)</a>

Illustrated by Makura Tami, offers a charming slice-of-life portrayal. The scene features an ordinary bookshelf adorned with a collection of books, while Littens playfully hide and slumber among them. Makura Tami's masterful use of a fisheye lens effect expands the perspective, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the room's surroundings. It's as if you, the viewer, are right there in the room, pondering whether you might be observing from across the way, perhaps as a Magikarp in a fish tank.

<a name="mew-ex"></a>![Mew Ex SV4PT5-232](https://tcgalmanac.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.pokemontcg.io%2Fsv4pt5%2F232_hires.png&w=1080&q=75)

### <a href="https://tcgalmanac.com/PokeCard/sv4pt5-232" target="_blank">Mew Ex (SV4PT5-232)</a>

Illustrated by USGMEN, boasts an incredible yet understated art style. With its use of bold block colors and simple line work, the Mew Ex card has become a beloved fan favorite. The inclusion of the iconic Ditto face lends the Pokémon card a charming and whimsical appeal, contributing to its designation as a Special Illustration Rare (SIR) and commanding a high price tag in the market. Additionally, there's a recurring motif of Mew associated with bubbles, often referencing it as an amniotic sac. This symbolism is prevalent in both the anime and the first Pokémon Movie, where Mew is depicted surrounded by bubbles before awakening.

<a name="aipom"></a>![Aipo SV4-211](https://tcgalmanac.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.pokemontcg.io%2Fsv4%2F211_hires.png&w=1080&q=75)

### <a href="https://tcgalmanac.com/PokeCard/sv4-211" target="_blank">Aipom (SV4-211)</a>

With art by Yuka Morii, introduces a unique artistic approach through clay sculptures. Morii employs oil-based modeling clay to meticulously craft and pose these Pokémon, capturing their essence within the perfect setting. The tactile nature of the clay adds depth and character to the artwork, making these cards highly sought after by collectors. The first appearance of these clay sculpture Pokémon cards can be traced back to the <a href="https://tcgalmanac.com/PokeSet/neo2" target="_blank">Neo Discovery set</a>, marking a distinct and cherished addition to any collection.

These are just a few of the Pokémon cards I've come across that stood out as the coolest in 2024. Each card possesses its own distinct qualities that contribute to its coolness factor. However, as a collector, what truly makes a card cool is subjective and personal. It's about how the card resonates with you, how it speaks to your interests and preferences.
Undoubtedly, there will be individuals who may disagree with my choices for the coolest Pokémon cards of 2024, and that's perfectly okay. Everyone should collect the cards that they find appealing and captivating.
My hope is that by reading this, you'll stumble upon Pokémon cards that pique your interest and ignite that sense of excitement and wonder. After all, the beauty of collecting lies in discovering what speaks to you and brings joy to your collection.
